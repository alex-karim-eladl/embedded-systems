Embedded Systems Coursework (Spring 2022)

The course consists of two related parts. The lectures cover theory, principle, and historical lessons about mobile and embedded systems, with topics ranging from ARM architecture, Linux kernel to real-time scheduling, PID control, and user interface technologies. There will be weekly reading assignments as related to the lectures.

The other part includes five substantial programming assignments using the STM32F411 that are designed in a way to require students to go beyond lectures to find out how things work. These assignments cover embedded Linux kernel development, FreeROS, baremetal programming, and eventually a minimum embedded kernel written in Rust.

Labs:
1. Linux kernel loadable module (10%)
2. Baremetal programming in C (20%)
3. Baremetal programming in Rust (10%)
4. A minimum embedded Rust kernel (I) (15%)
5. A minimum embedded Rust kernel (II) (15%)
